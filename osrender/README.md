# osrender

Single-pass GPU renderer for reframed clips. `gpu_render.py` hands it the
clip, a JSON plan and an output path:

    osrender <input.mp4> <plan.json> <output.mp4>

NVDEC decodes into CUDA frames, the kernels in `src/kernels.cu` compose each
output frame from the plan's layers (a source rectangle scaled into an output
rectangle, optionally blurred) plus an optional image overlay, and NVENC
encodes straight from device memory. The frames never leave the card, and
the whole clip is one process instead of one ffmpeg per scene plus a concat.
The output is video only; the caller muxes the clip's audio back in.

The plan is not a second copy of the layouts: `gpu_render.layers_from_graph`
reads the filtergraph each scene would hand ffmpeg. A graph it cannot read,
a source NVDEC cannot decode, a missing binary or any error renders through
ffmpeg exactly as before. Clipedit enables this path only with `GPU_RENDER=1`;
it is off by default pending validation on the rental GPU.

## Building

For the documented Vast Ubuntu image, set `GPU_RENDER=1` before running the
bootstrap. `ops/vast/build-gpu-renderer.sh` installs the build libraries and
Rust 1.90.0, compiles with the committed Cargo.lock and installs the binary.
It caches successful builds; the first setup is longer. The ordinary setup
does not build it. Alternatively, build by hand against your runtime's FFmpeg:

    apt-get install pkg-config clang libclang-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev \
      libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev
    cargo build --release --locked

`libcuda.so.1` is loaded at run time, so the binary builds without the CUDA
toolkit. `src/kernels.ptx` is generated from `src/kernels.cu` and committed;
after editing the kernels, regenerate it with

    nvcc -ptx -O3 -arch=compute_75 src/kernels.cu -o src/kernels.ptx

(`compute_75` PTX is compiled by the driver for any newer card).

## Tests

`tests/test_gpu_render.py` covers the plan side in CI. On a machine with the
binary and NVENC, `tests/test_gpu_render_equivalence.py` renders every layout
through both paths and requires the same frame count and SSIM >= 0.97
(`OSRENDER_BIN=... OSRENDER_TEST_VIDEO=clip.mp4 pytest tests/test_gpu_render_equivalence.py`).
